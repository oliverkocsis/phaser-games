# Phaser Games

Phaser Games leverages [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) both for local development and deployed production system. 

Jekyll is a static site generator so we need Jekyll to build the site before we can view it. There are two commands you can run in the root of your site to build it:

- `jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called _site.
- `jekyll serve` - Does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at http://localhost:4000.

When you’re developing a site you’ll use jekyll serve as it updates with any changes you make.

Run jekyll serve and go to http://localhost:4000 in your browser.
